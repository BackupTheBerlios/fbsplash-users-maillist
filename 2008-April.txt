Subject: [fbsplash-users] splashutils-1.5.4.1 released
Message-ID: <20080420090931.GA8291@spock.one.pl>

Hi everyone,

Just a quick note to let you know that splashutils-1.5.4.1 has just been
released.  Due to a surprisingly low number of bug reports for the 1.5.4
version of splashutils, 1.5.4.1 only contains two simple fixes.  Excerpt
from the ChangeLog:

20 Apr 2008 * <spock at gentoo.org> * splashutils-1.5.4.1
- Use a monotonic clock for animation timing calculations (this is
  fixes the problem of animations freezing when the system clock is
  updated).
- Compile the bundled libraries with -O2 instead of -Os (fixes a
  segfault in freetype when compiled with GCC 4.3.0).

Best regards.
