Subject: [fbsplash-users] fbsplash is not working with static redeon module
Message-ID: <CAKKQ_KdajQZkevhGFQ1j7c89CZg+eVHjH887Qyx4ckeR=BQFuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I am using fbslash to display spash screen while booting.
I am using kernel 2.6.35. I can display splash screen and progress
animation.
For some reasons recently I rebuild the kernel changing radeon driver from
module to builtin.
>From then fbsplash is not working, no display of splash screen or progress
bar.

What could be the problem? Do we need to have radeon driver as module only?


thanks

Subject: [fbsplash-users] fblsplash increasing bootup time
Message-ID: <CAKKQ_Kdpn7mzQaS3cWJdM7wfVag8PoK9Jp_CRnvqzadmCL4o-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am using fbsplashd from my init like following
fbsplashd --theme=default --pidfile=//lib/splash/cache/daemon.pid
--type=bootup > /dev/null 2>&1
echo "set tty silent tty1" > //lib/splash/cache/.splash
echo "set mode silent" > //lib/splash/cache/.splash
echo "paint" > //lib/splash/cache/.splash
echo "set autoverbose 0" > //lib/splash/cache/.splash
/sbin/fbcondecor_ctl.static -c on 2>/dev/null
fbsplash is working fine but it causes bootup time to be increased by 2
seconds is there anything i am missing or doing wrong ?


thanks
praveen
