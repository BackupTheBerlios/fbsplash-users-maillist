Subject: [fbsplash-users] error from  splash-functions-bl1.sh on livecd
Message-ID: <1264707062.26454.927.camel@genx.localdomain>

In my home made gentoo livecd 
(REF: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=244837 ),
splash works fine for most of the boot, however, near the end, when it
switches to verbose mode, I see this error: 
/sbin/splash-functions-bl1.sh: line 200: /lib/splash/cache/levels: Read-only file system
/sbin/splash-functions-bl1.sh: line 201: /lib/splash/cache/levels: Read-only file system
And the screen goes black (no lcd backlight).

Any ideas what causes this?

mount -l shows
cachedir on /mnt/livecd/lib/splash/tmp type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size-4096k,mode=644)

If I press ctrl-alt-F1, the verbose console is displayed.
If I press F2 during the boot, I remain in verbose mode, but still see
the script error.
'chvrt 1' can also switch to the verbose terminal.

I am using media-gfx/splashutils-1.5.4.3

Any chance you could switch to openrc and baselayout2?
