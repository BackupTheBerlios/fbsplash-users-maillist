I doubt we'll need debugging symbols from anything outside of
splashutils, so that will most likely not be an issue.  I think it would
be very helpful if you could compile splashutils with the debugging
symbols and run it under gdb to get a backtrace.

Also, please see whether you by any chance have the /usr/lib/nptl directory
on that system.  If you do, just get back to me without doing the gdb stuff,
as this might be a regression, which I know how to fix :)

Hi,

Could you please keep fbsplash-users CC-ed?  I think what we discuss
here could prove useful to other people in the future.

Well, if it starts to work after a setting from CFLAGS/LDFLAGS has been
changed, then that would provide us some useful info as well.

How about simply running:

FEATURES="nostrip" CFLAGS="-g" LDFLAGS="-nopie" emerge splashutils?

Subject: [fbsplash-users] I keep getting: fbcon_decor error.
Message-ID: <933fbf3c0809291156p3730f219oc22bc09e3b96e677@mail.gmail.com>

I think I've done everything that's needed.
CONFIG_FB_UVESA=y
CONFIG_CONNECTOR=y
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE="/usr/share/v86d/initramfs"
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y

*cat .config | grep FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DETECT_PRIMARY is not set
# CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_ROTATION is not set

is it right?

/etc/init.d/fbcondecor status
 * Caching service dependencies ...                                       [
ok ]
 * status:  started

and I've added to grub.conf:
 video=uvesafb:1024x768-16,mtrr:3,ywrap
splash=verbose,fadein,theme:emergence quiet CONSOLE=/dev/tty1

but I still can't get any splash image.
when I do: splash_manager --theme=gentoo --cmd=set --tty=2
I've getting:
"
 Failed to open the fbcon_decor control device.
Failed to open the fbcon_decor control device.
"

can anyone help me?

The settings are correct, but do you have framebuffer
console decorations enabled as well?
(that's CONFIG_FB_CON_DECOR)

Looks like you're missing /dev/fbcon_decor.
