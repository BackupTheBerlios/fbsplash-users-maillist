Subject: [fbsplash-users] How kernel selects theme?
Message-ID: <l2qe20994341004190731t32df829cv8745b505c7ccb02e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!
I'm wondering how kernel with fbcondecor patch selects splash theme on boot,
because it seems it doesn't :)

When I set "splash=silent,theme:suspend2" nothing happens. Several extra
printk commands show me
that fbcondecor_helper is called without theme parameter:
...
fbcondecor: argv /usr/local/sbin/fbcondecor_helper 2 init 0 0 <NULL>
...

Actually, vc_cons[i].d->vc_decor.theme is set to NULL in fbcon_decor_reset()
(see drivers/video/console/fbcondecor.c), and I can't find where it is set
to
correct theme specified.

I even made little patch that sets "default" theme on reset, and it works!

--- a/drivers/video/console/fbcondecor.c
+++ b/drivers/video/console/fbcondecor.c
@@ -526,7 +526,8 @@ void fbcon_decor_reset(void)
        for (i = 0; i < MAX_NR_CONSOLES && vc_cons[i].d; i++) {
                vc_cons[i].d->vc_decor.state = vc_cons[i].d->vc_decor.twidth
=

vc_cons[i].d->vc_decor.theight = 0;
-               vc_cons[i].d->vc_decor.theme = NULL;
+//             vc_cons[i].d->vc_decor.theme = NULL;
+               vc_cons[i].d->vc_decor.theme = "default";
        }

        return;

Thus I use kernel 2.6.29 with fbcondecor-0.9.6 and splash in "default"
folder.
But I feel I've missed something. Could somebody point me?
