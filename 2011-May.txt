Subject: [fbsplash-users] How can I get fbsplash to work on my embedded
	device
Message-ID: <BANLkTimCyssOZS26Bug_rTA6U=m=eaGm6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,



I am working on a project to get our company logo to display on the screen
during boot-up before our application starts up.  Our platform is an
embedded Medical device running a custom configured version of Linux called
X-Linux using the kernel 2.6.38.2.  It has a 128 MB DOM as well.  Our
development platform is running Ubuntu 10.04 on a Virtual Box that is run on
Windows XP.



I have compiled splashutils-1.5.4.3 on our Ubuntu platform and have copied
some of the utilities to the right locations in the device?s filesystem as
well as created a theme.  I have also updated our bootloader (syslinux)
configuration file to append the proper kernel parameters needed for
fbsplash (e.g. splash=silent, theme:THEME,etc).  I am able to start the
fbslash daemon from our /etc/init.d/rcS script and want to stop the daemon
right before our application starts up.  It seems like the daemon is using
98% of the CPU cycles when it is running.  How can this be?



What is the command to stop the daemon from running?  Also, I?m not getting
our logo to be displayed either?just a black screen.  What needs to be
called in the initscript(s) to make this happen?



Thank you for your time.

I use these commands in the init script:

PIPE=/lib/splash/cache/.splash

# calculate the PROGRESS

echo "progress $PROGRESS" > "$PIPE"
echo "repaint" > "$PIPE"
echo "set mode silent" > "$PIPE"

Off course you should have correct theme config with silent picture set.
On my systems it's 
silentpic=/etc/splash/default/images/silent-640x480.png
and boot video mode set to 640x480 16 bit.

/usr/local/sbin/fbsplashd -t default -p 10000 -q --type=bootup
--pidfile="$PIDFILE"

To stop the daemon just send it "exit" command:

PIPE=/lib/splash/cache/.splash
echo "exit" > "$PIPE"

Hello,

I was just wondering what needs to happen in order for a theme to be
displayed on the screen?  Also, can fbsplash work on embedded devices?

Thanks!

Hello,

No, I have not patched the kernel.  What is the patch and where can I find
it?  We're using the 2.6.29.6 kernel.

Actually, I'm not sure if you have to apply the patch,
but I've never tried fbsplash without it.

It aims to show the splash as early as possible - just after
the kernel has started.
