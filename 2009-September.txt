Message-ID: <1253919458.22282.38.camel@genx.localdomain>

In my linuxrc, I get a new error when using:
  splash_comm_send "set mode silent"
Error:
  Switch to tty16 failed with: 9 'Bad File descriptor'

These are the steps in the linuxrc that lead up to the error.

#!/bin/bash
export PATH="/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin"
Debug=0
CONSOLE=/dev/console
exec >${CONSOLE} <${CONSOLE} 2>&1
mount -t proc none /proc  &> /dev/null
mount -t sysfs /sys /sys >/dev/null 2>&1

splash_comm_send "set tty silent ${SPLASH_TTY}"
splash_comm_send "Initializing system..."
splash_comm_send "repaint"
splash_comm_send "set mode silent" 

My kernel: 2.6.30-gentoo-r6

My /proc/cmdline:
  ramdisk_size=33000 root=/dev/ram0 rw init=/linuxrc cdroot console=tty1 video=i810fb:vram:4,xres:1023,yres:74,hsync1:30,hsync2:81,vsync1:56,vsync2:76,accel splash=silent,kdraphics,theme:simsplash block2mtd.block2mtd=/dev/hdc3

I have never had a /dev/tty16, so I'm not sure why it is using that.
In /dev/ I do have

console     5, 1
tty         4, 0
tty1        4, 1
fb0        29, 0
fbcondecor 10, 26

Not sure what else might be relevant.

Look at the definition of the splash_setup() function in
/sbin/splash-functions.sh -- this is where SPLASH_TTY acquires the
default value of 16.

You might want to create a tty16 device node in your /dev, or use a
different tty for the silent splash screen.

Also, you mentioned that this is a new error.  What has changed since
the last time it worked for you?

Best regards,
Michal

I wonder what SPLASH_TTY was set to before?

I create /dev/tty16, with no improvement.
The device file is there, but the error remains the same.

What is different:
* I updated all my packages; among them,
  kernel upgraded from 2.6.27-gentoo-r8 to 2.6.30-gentoo-r6
  media-gfx/splashutils upgrade from 1.5.4.2 to 1.5.4.3

* The minor number for /dev/fbcondecor changed from 63 to 62, and the
old minor number no longer works.

* /bin/pidof is now a soft link to /sbin/killall5, so I have to also
include killall5 in my initrd.

* In my old script to prepare the initrd, 
  if [ ! -d ./dev/fb ]; then mkdir ./dev/fb; fi
  mknod ./dev/fb/0 c 29 0
  mknod ./dev/fb/1 c 29 1
  ln -s fb/0 ./dev/fb0
  ln -s fb/1 ./dev/fb1
But now I have:
  mknod ./dev/fbcondecor c 10 62
  mknod ./dev/fb0 c 29 0

* As a bad-developer I probably made some un-tracked change.

I think it has been set to 16 for quite a while.

Please keep it there, though -- that device node is required for the
splash daemon to work properly.

Could you please try downgrading splashutils to the previous version?

That's to be expected, there are no guarantees about the minor number,
as it's assigned dynamically by the kernel.

Actually, I had a look at the code and it looks like the thing you're
missing is /dev/tty0.

I don't think I'm out of the woods yet.

I still see text from linuxrc errors and the beginning of init, which
used to be hidden by the silent splash.

I had to change the splash commands in linuxrc to make splash work at
all, leaving me unsure if I'm doing this correctly for
media-gfx/splashutils-1.5.4.3

Is there a good reference or script for what I need in my custom
linuxrc, to smoothly get from grub though init without seeing any text?

This is my /boot/grub/menu.lst:
hiddenmenu
default 0
prompt  0
timeout 0
serial --unit=1 --speed=9600 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1
terminal serial
title MyGentoo Kernel: linux-2.6.30-gentoo-r6
root (hd0,0)
kernel /boot/kernel-genkernel-x86-2.6.30-gentoo-r6 ramdisk_size=33000 root=/dev/ram0 rw init=/linuxrc cdroot CONSOLE=/dev/tty1 console=ttyS1,9600 quiet video=i810fb:vram:4,xres:1024,yres:768,bpp:24,hsync1:30,hsync2:81,vsync1:56,vsync2:76,accel splash=silent,kdgraphics,theme:my_splash block2mtd.block2mtd=/dev/hdc3
initrd /boot/initrd


This is what I now have in linuxrc now:
. /sbin/splash-functions.sh
splash_setup
fbcondecor_supported
fbcondecor_helper
fbcondecor_set_theme my_splash
splash_comm_send "set mode silent"


This is what did work before my system upgrade, but doesn't work now:
. /sbin/splash-functions.sh
splash_setup
BOOT_MSG="$(splash_get_boot_message)" ${spl_daemon} --theme="${SPLASH_THEME}" --pidfile="${spl_pidfile}" --type=${ttype} ${options}
splash_comm_send "set tty silent ${SPLASH_TTY}"
splash_comm_send "Initializing system..."
splash_comm_send "repaint"

If there is, it's someone's custom script as well.  The officially
supported distros (Gentoo, Debian) use a slightly different setup than
what you had, so they probably won't be very useful.

OK.

This doesn't do anything.

> fbcondecor_helper

Since you are calling the splash helper here, it will only paint the
silent splash image.  If it doesn't even do that, try
'fbcondecor_heleper 2 init' instead.  Since this only paints the image
and exits, any further error messages will not be properly hidden.

> fbcondecor_set_theme my_splash

OK.

> splash_comm_send "set mode silent"

This doesn't do anything since the splash daemon is not running at
this point (you didn't start it).

That looks like a more correct way of doing things, since you're
starting the splash daemon, which guarantees that any error messages
will be hidden, and the screen will be properly repainted if
necessary.  What happens if you try to use this old script after the
system upgrade?  Is the splash picture displayed at all?  Do you see
any error messages?

I booted and executed the commands that look more correct, followed by
starting a shell.

The console background is black (no frame buffer), so it's not switching
to the silent splash tty.

The process list shows, on tty16, with process id 439, the command:
//sbin/fbsplashd.static --theme=simsplash --pidfile=//lib/splash/cache/daemon.pid --type= silent,kdgraphics,theme:my_splash

I successfully switched to the silent tty with:
. /sbin/splash-functions.sh
splash_setup
splash_comm_send "set mode silent"

This is very good! Yay!
I changed the splash lines in my linuxrc to:

. /sbin/splash-functions.sh
splash_setup
BOOT_MSG="$(splash_get_boot_message)" ${spl_daemon} --theme="${SPLASH_THEME}" --pidfile="${spl_pidfile}" --type=${ttype} ${options}
splash_comm_send "set tty silent ${SPLASH_TTY}"
splash_comm_send "set mode silent"

Now I see the silent splash, but the progress bar doesn't seem to work.
Near the end of init, splash does quickly drop out to verbose tty to display an rc init error I can't capture (goes by quickly).

The progress bar might be because I loose the state info as I do a pivot_root and chroot later in the linuxrc.
To compensate, I unsuccessfully added this before the pivot_root:
mount -o bind /sys /new/sys
mount -o bind /pro /new/proc
mount -o bind /lib/splash /new/lib/splash

So it looks like we have solved the problem of talking to the daemon to display the silent splash is working. 
Thank you!

Now the problem seems to be updating the boot progress bar....
