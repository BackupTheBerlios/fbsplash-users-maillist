Subject: [fbsplash-users] fbcondecor required for early userspace?
Message-ID: <20080816131228.pqt6rdmiow048cwg@www.wmltd.co.uk>

Hi List,

I note that the fbcondecor kernel patch is not required to display
images on a framebuffer once the kernel has mounted the roofs and
started the init system.

Is the fbcondecor patch required for an early userspace splash image?
I ask because in the docs (for release 1.5.4.1) it states that
fbcondecor_helper is needed in the initramfs.

Cheers,

Seb James

The short answer is: yes, if you want to see a splash screen at the early
boot stage, then you need a kernel patched with fbcondecor.  The
fbcondecor patch causes the kernel to make a call to the userspace
fbcondecor_helper app right after the framebuffer is initialized, which
makes it possible to display the splash image at a very early stage.

However, if you're fine with displaying the image somewhat later, after
the kernel has finished booting, but before the root filesystem is
mounted -- i.e. when the userspace code from an initrd/initramfs is
executed, then the fbcondecor patch is not needed.  You'd still
probably want to include fbcondecor_helper in the initramfs and use
it from there, as it's much smaller than the main fbsplash daemon
binary and can be used to display a static splash image (which is
usually enough at the early boot stage).

Subject: [fbsplash-users] fbsplashd.static segfaults on hardened system
Message-ID: <48B727F6.5060609@lavabit.com>

Hi all,

I'm having trouble with splashutils on one of my catalyst projects (x86
arch). fbsplashd.static segfaults right after the splash image is shown
on the screen, preventing the loaders to progress, pressing F2 for
verbose mode etc. This is what dmesg says when running "splash_manager
-c demo -t <any theme> -m s":

	Aug 28 20:20:04 livecd fbsplashd.stati[22764]: segfault at 9 ip
	0811ac2e sp 4ac7bc60 error 4 in
	fbsplashd.static[8048000+186000]Aug 28 20:20:04 livecd grsec:
	signal 11 sent to
	/mnt/livecd/sbin/fbsplashd.static[fbsplashd.stati:22764]
	uid/euid:0/0 gid/egid:0/0, parent /mnt/livecd/sbin/init[init:1]
	uid/euid:0/0 gid/egid:0/0
	Aug 28 20:20:04 livecd grsec: denied resource overstep by

	uid/euid:0/0 gid/egid:0/0, parent /mnt/livecd/sbin/init[init:1]
	uid/euid:0/0 gid/egid:0/0

Now, this only happens on my hardened branch of the project. I'm using a
hardened toolchain (gcc 3.4.6), PaX, grsec (no RBAC yet though) and all
that, but other than that the only differences between the hardened and
non-hardened branches are, essentially, the portage profiles
(hardened/linux/x86/2008.0 vs. default/linux/x86/2008.0) and the CFLAGS:

hardened:
	-mtune=i486 -Os -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -fforce-addr

non-hardened:
	-march=i686 -Os -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer

This affects both splashutils 1.5.3.4 (currently stable in portage) and
1.5.4.2 current latest release), using stock portage ebuilds. I've
looked in the ebuilds, and seen that there is stuff for hardened (adding
-fnostack-protector) so I assume splashutils generally should work on
hardened systems.

I've done some simple debugging and found what causes the segfault,
namely this part:

	if [[ -n "${t}" ]]; then
		spl_comm "set event dev /dev/input/${t}"
	fi

in the function demo_theme_silent() of splash_manager. Commenting it out
gets splash working. At the time of the crash, t is set to "event0", and
doing a:

	cat /dev/input/event0

seems to indicate it is in fact the keyboard we're dealing with. I have
no idea why fbsplashd.static segfaults when trying to do its thing with
it though.

Any thoughts on what could be wrong?

Cheers!

Could you please try the following two things:

* Modify splash_manager to use the dynamically linked version of
  fbsplashd and see whether this changes anything.

* Start fbsplashd manually and do 
  `echo set event dev /dev/input/event0 > /lib/splash/cache/.splash`
  Does it cause the splash daemon to segfault?

Best regards.
