Subject: [fbsplash-users] boot splash with KMS enabled (Intel drivers 2.10.0,

Hi,

I'm having some troubles trying to set up the boot splash image with  
the latest Intel drivers with KMS enabled. I disabled the support for  
the different framebuffer devices and the i915 module is built into  
the kernel image. The boot splash image doesn't show at all, despite  
the resolution being set correctly. It just shows a small blinking  
cursor on the top left corner of the screen and it stays there until X  
starts up. Another thing is that now I always get an "Undefined video  
mode" error in the boot loader. Is it possible to get rid of this error?

Thanks,

Ant?nio Santos

What kernel command line arguments are you using? (see /proc/cmdline)
Does splash_manager -c demo work for you if you start it from tty1
after the system has finished booting?

Best regards,

Well, before moving on to using KMS with the latest Intel drivers, I  
used vesa fb and I didn't put anything special in the kernel command  
line (I'm using extlinux as boot loader):

APPEND ro root=/dev/sda1

Now, I tried appending "splash", "video=inteldrmfb", "console=tty1",  
etc, and nothing works.

In dmesg I have:

Feb 17 10:25:56 classSTB user.info kernel: [drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0  
20060810

It seems it is loading the inteldrmfb framebuffer ok.

Regarding splash_manager, unfortunately I'm not able to use any of the  
scripts provided by splashutils, since I'm running this in a box with  
busybox which doesn't provide bash (only ash).

Thanks,

Ant?nio Santos
