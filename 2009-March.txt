Message-ID: <b3f657660903121049u42ae454cw1c6e351f7ccac01d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there!

I'm using fbsplash on debian sid in combination with uswsusp (because of
that nice suspend to both, ram&disk feature). uswsusp has decent support for
fbsplash, but it has to be activeted at compilation and the debian
maintainers deceided to use splashy instead. I'll write to the
uswsusp-mailinglist & ask for implementing the possibility to choose the
splash-feature on runtime, but in the meantime - since you keep this nice
little debian-repository, would you mind adding a uswsusp-package with
fbsplash-support for users who don't feel comfortable compiling their
packages themselves? Or maybe add the instructions to your wiki:

uswsusp & fbsplash for debian:

- check the apt-howto if you're not familiar with the debian way of
installing packages from source
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
- get the uswsusp-source package 'apt-get source uswsusp' and (some of) the
necessary dependencies 'apt-get build-dep uswsusp'
- edit the 'debian/rules' file inside the downloaded sources: change
'--enable-splashy' to '--disable-splashy' and add '--enable-fbsplash'
- try compiling read the error-messages and download the remaining
dependencies (apt-get build-dep wont fetch the fbsplash-related
dependencies)
- after compilation was fine, install the new package & pin it (otherwise
it'll be overwritten on the next update)
- edit '/etc/uswsusp.conf' and add 'splash=y'

..sometimes I regret having left gentoo ;)
anyway, thanks to all for your work on fbsplash!

Hello,

I'll give it a try with packaging it and tell you.

Cheers, JD.

Done for i386, though untested. Can you please test ? I can and will do the 
amd64 version, but cannot do the power-pc version -;

Repository:
deb ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/fbsplash/debian/uswsusp sid contrib
deb-src ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/fbsplash/debian/uswsusp sid contrib

The version is:
apt-get install uswsusp=0.8-1.1+fbsplash

Thanks, Cheers, Jean-Damien.

tested & works! I'll let you know, if I get an answer from the uswsusp-devs
about including the option to choose the splash at runtime.

thanks a lot,

Subject: [fbsplash-users] custom initrd splash
Message-ID: <1237320740.11229.140.camel@genx.localdomain>

I am creating an installer CD that uses splashutils-1.5.4.2 to make
things look nice.

The system boots with custom initrd/linuxrc I created, by 
mounting resources, launch splash, and then launch a curses menu.

I would like to start the system in silent splash mode early in the
boot, and  switch to verbose just before launching the curses install
menu.

I am having difficulty finding the right command to switch between
verbose and silent and back.

Any help much appreciated!

If you have the splash daemon running in the background (which
is generally the case after you have finished booting off an
initrd and are running from the rootfs), you can use the
splash_silent() and splash_verbose() functions from
/sbin/splash-functions.sh.

If you do not have a splash daemon running, the process is slightly
more complicated.  You will start in silent mode, so there is no
need to activate the silent splash screen manually from the script.
Fbcondecor should then also be automatically activated on the
first tty.  If that doesn't work or if you want to to use a different
theme on the 1st tty, you can also run:

if fbcondecor_supported ; then
   fbcondecor_set_theme simsplash 1
fi

Then, if you want to switch to verbose mode, you can just
execute `chvt 1`.  If you want to switch to the silent mode
afterwards, run `fbcondecor_helper 2 repaint`.

You might also want to have a look at gentoo/initrd.splash
(in the fbsplash git repo) for some sample fbsplash/fbcondecor
code that is designed to be run from an initrd.
