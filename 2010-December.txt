Message-ID: <SNT132-w52B0E54C2FD875D088C7F5842C0@phx.gbl>


I am using a standard gentoo install as a base to extract files from to create a custom small Linux distro.  I think I am copying just about everything from the baselayout, sysvinit, important libraries, and splashutils packages (no man pages or pkg detail files)...  The startup splash, with progress bar, appears to work ok, although I don't see it get to 100% before it goes to verbose mode..  However, when shutting down or rebooting, the splash screen (with progress bar) displays the startup progress bar at 95% and does not change.  The last step in the init startup process is to launch X via startx for a default user.  If I comment this line I see the startup and shutdown progress bar work properly, but if I allow to go directly to X then the progress bar doesn't work..

Is there anything I can do to force the shutdown progress bar to begin and progress normally, or is there a way to progress the startup to 100% (thinking that this will help) at the end of the init loading?

What have I done wrong??

Suggestions?

Are you launching this using a custom-made initscript?  If this is a
custom initscript, have you set the SPLASH_XSERVICE variable in
/etc/conf.d/splash?

Yes, please do.  It shouldn't break anything and might actually fix
some of the problems you are experiencing.  The fbsplash subsystem is
designed around the assumption that it "knows" which initscript starts
X.

No I have not done this...  X is starting, should I still do this?  I am currently starting X with an initscript at the end of default (just before local).  My initscripts are pretty standard, I haven't altered the sysvinit package or baselayout (1).

During my debugging I noticed that the list of services to start (/lib/splash/cache/svcs_start) was different that the progress shown after boot had completed and X had started (/lib/splash/cache/progress).  I found that in my local (/etc/conf.d/local.start) script the last item was returning a bad status.  I fixed this and things started working.  I also added the SPLASH_XSERVICE variable to /etc/conf.d/splash, but I didn't see any difference after it started to work.

Another question however, is there a variable I can use to show what is currently in progress during startup?  I am currently displaying the boot percentage (Booting the system $progress%) but would like to show the script that is current also.

Thanks for the help,

-CJ

You can use the 'msglog' option of the 'text' directive in the config
file to display a simple message log containing names of the
initscripts being stated, for example:

  <textbox>
     text silent dejavu.ttf 12 100 100 #ffffff "System messages:"
     text silent courier.ttf 10 100 120 #eeeeee msglog
  </textbox>

You can find the full documentation in docs/theme_format in the
splashutils tarball.  Please note that if you decide to place the text
msglog directive inside a textbox, you might need to press F3 to
actually see it during boot.
