hi spock,

i'm using a debian lenny 2.6.26 kernel with your patch
and splashutils 1.5.4.2

it is all ok, but when the system boots (silent), it doesn't go
automatically to verbose after boots (i remember that with gentoo it
does it automatically)
i have to hit alt+f1 to enter in verbose mode (and to log-in)

can you help me? what i have to modify to go automatically to verbose
after boots? is there a command to do it? in that case i can put it in
rc.local

many thanks

[repost sorry if you get it for the 2nd time]

Hello,

What is your corresponding grub line, and is there something relevant 
about splash and/or fbcondecor in your /var/log/[syslog,messages] ?

Thanks, Cheers, Jean-Damien.

This is a difference of gentoo v.s. the other distribs, on Gentoo there 
are service-related events.
On Debian, there is no more splash action but the ones their systemv rc 
supports, i.e. progress() or stop() (yes, nothing else).

That's why the automatic between verbose and silent is not working: this 
is a triggered on an event that is not propagated to splash.

You can send a wishlist to the author of sysv-rc about service-related 
events -;

The 'rm /lib/splash/cache' error message is a known thing that you do 
not have to worry about - this is harmless - will be fixed OOTD.

Thanks, Cheers, JD.

Do you know how this problem is solved in usplash/splashy,
which are perhaps more "native" to Debian than fbsplash?

If there really is no way to know when the boot process is
actually complete, maybe we could make use of the autoverbose
functionality in fbsplash.  From gentoo/splash.conf (in git):

# If set to a positive value, fbsplash will automatically switch to verbose
# mode if there is no activity for the specified number of seconds.
SPLASH_AUTOVERBOSE="0"

I could imagine that on Debian systems we could set it to
a non-zero value, preventing fbsplash from staying at the
silent screen forever.

Hi,

Here's my question/problem:
I have encrypted root partition and I use custom initscript (attached)
to decrypt it during boot. However, after decryption I don't know,
how to display splash screen again. I tried chvt 2 and 16, but it results
in switch to black console, shortly followed by switch back to first console,
where I can see boot messages, until something from gentoo's init kicks in
and I get splash screen back. So, how do I switch to silent splash from 
initramfs?

Best regards,
Bartek Cwiklowski

You need to directly call fbcondecor_helper from your initscript:

/sbin/fbcondecor_helper 2 repaint

Ok, that worked, thanks. 

The only weird thing is, that trying to resume (echo go > 
/sys/power/tuxonice/do_resume), which returns immediately if there is no 
hibernation image available, switches again to first console. There is some way 
to explicitly check for images existence (can't remember it now), but in case 
if it is a bug, I'm reporting it.

Does it also happen when fbcondecor is inactive?  If it does, then
it's more likely a tuxonice problem.

Yes, when splash isn't enabled on kernel cmdline (but tuxonice is) it also 
switches. I'll report it to the toi devs, if I can't work around it.

Thanks for your help.
