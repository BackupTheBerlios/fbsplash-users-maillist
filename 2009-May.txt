Could you please provide a screenshot of the screen of the random colors
and the output of `fbset -i`?

Which version of the fbcondecor patch are you using?

Are you able to activate fbcondecor after boot using fbcondecor_ctl?

You might want to have a look at the fblogo app (e.g.
http://packages.debian.org/etch/fblogo).

Subject: [fbsplash-users] start-from-initrd and start-from-kernel
Message-ID: <d7b1fc230905080455t1acbd2b5uaee5903ef47a0226@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I?m using fbsplash in my system, starting from rc.

I would like to start splash as soon as possible to avoid showing messages
to my customers. I've been reading here:

http://fbsplash.berlios.de/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:internals

But start-from-initrd and start-from-kernel are not documented. Is there a
place where I can find how to enable start-from-initrd or, even better,
start-from-kernel?

Could you tell me how to do it or how to find the information to do it?

Thanks in advance
Antonio

You will probably want to use what is referred to as 'start-from-kernel'
in the document you cited.  You will need to patch your kernel with
the fbcondecor patch, use an initramfs generated with the
splash_geninitramfs script and provide the correct splash settings
on the kernel command line (e.g. splash=silent,fadein,theme:foobar
quiet console=tty1).

More details about this can be found in docs/early_bootup in the
splashutils tarball.  The distro-specific documentation on the
fbsplash website could also prove to be helpful
(http://fbsplash.berlios.de/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:distros).

Hope that helps,
