Subject: [fbsplash-users] fbcondecor not working
Message-ID: <48F10FAD.1050306@gmail.com>

Hello, I have a problem with fbcondecor.

Every time I try to turn on fbcondecor with 'fbcondecor_ctl -c on', I
get the error message "FBIOCONDECOR_SETSTATE failed, error code 22". I
used strace to run fbcondecor, and the ioctl on /dev/fbcondecor returns
EINVAL. I traced it to the function fbcon_decor_enable in fbcondecor.c,
and I found out that it is not working because of (!info->bgdecor.data
&& vc->vc_num == fg_console).
What is the problem?

Did you run `fbcondecor_ctl -c setcfg` and `fbcondecor_ctl -c setpic` for
that tty first?  Alternatively, you might want to try using
 `splash_manager -c set` instead.

Thanks for the quick reply, but unfortunately, it still does not work
correctly:

# splash-manager -c set -t sunset
FBIOCONDECOR_SETCFG failed, error code 22.
FBIOCONDECOR_SETSTATE failed, error code 22.
# fbcondecor_ctl -c setcfg -t sunset
FBIOCONDECOR_SETCFG failed, error code 22.
# fbcondecor_ctl -c setpic -t sunset
#

By the way, the silent splash works correctly, and the /dev/fbcondecor
file exists.

Are you sure the fbcondecor settings in the theme file
are correct?  SETCFG failing suggests that something might
be wrong with the theme config (text field larger than the
screen, etc).  If everything seems fine to you, can you
upload the theme somewhere so that I can take a look?

Thanks! I found the problem in the config file: it turns out that I used
'ty=' instead of 'th=', making the ty= line appear twice. So that was
the problem. Thanks a lot!
