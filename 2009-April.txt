Subject: [fbsplash-users] fbsplash built on T2 Linux, but no splash
Message-ID: <de7991c50904291948h64c175d4kb3356b0b6be0f733@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,
I built fbsplash on my T2 linux, I followed the LFS guide on the fbsplash
website to install it, I updated my grub conf, now, the problem is that
there's no boot splash, just a black screen with some random colors, and
after that, the boot process starts, with the fbsplash logo at the top left,
the resolution changed fine (1024*768), I'm running Linux on a virtual
machine in VMware. Why there's no splash screen? I have the emergence theme
installed though, and I generated the initrd as indicated on the
documentation:
splash_geninitramfs -g /boot/initrd-fbsplash -r 1024x768 -v emergence
And here's the fbsplash grub entry:
title fbsplash
kernel (hd0,0)/boot/vmlinuz_2.6.29-dist root=/dev/sda1 vga=791
splash=verbose,fadein,theme:emergence quiet CONSOLE=tty1
initrd (hd0,0)/boot/initrd-fbsplash

I have also another question, how can I change the default fbsplash logo
that appears in the top left of the screen?
Any hints would be appreciated.
