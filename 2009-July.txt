Message-ID: <BAY141-W102D95D6A1956A66944CC59D100@phx.gbl>


Hi there.

I got fbsplash running on debian, but not quite as smoth as I would like.
After booting from grub I get a few kernel mesages befour the framebuffer is enabled so some kernel mesages are shown.
During boot some flashing ocour.
There seam also to be some bleed trough on the splash image.
Is there anything I can do to improve this?
uswsusp?

A very few messages, so do I - but does the progress bar start near the 
beginning or jumps suddenly to something e.g. 20% ?

> During boot some flashing ocour.

This has do to with the *console* debian packages: it redefines the 
fonts on every tty - on the fbsplash wiki there is a solution with one 
of the console package (don't remember its name), and on sid this has 
been superseeded by another package, for which I did not had time to 
investigate yet, and that makes the flashing back again - anyway this 
has to do with tty font config.

Which theme are you using ?

See the archives of this list - I built an fbsplash-aware uswsusp some 
time ago - dunno if the current uswsusp in debian lenny official repos 
is now fbsplash-aware

Cheers, JD.
